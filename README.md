## 📖 Abstract
This project aims to detect **hate speech in Twitter data** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The dataset consists of tweets labeled as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral text. The model processes text, extracts features, and classifies tweets into appropriate categories.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`twitter.csv`) contains:
- **Tweet Text**: The main text content of tweets.
- **Labels**: Categorization as *Hate Speech*, *Offensive*, or *Neutral*.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- 🏷 **Classify tweets** based on hate speech detection.
- 📊 **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand word distributions and patterns.
- 🤖 **Train a Machine Learning Model** for classification.
- 🚀 **Improve text-processing techniques** for better accuracy.

---

## 🛠 Model & Data Processing
### 📌 Hate Speech Detection Model (`Hate Speech Detection.ipynb`)
This **Jupyter Notebook** contains:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning text (removing stopwords, punctuation, and lemmatization).
- **Feature Engineering**: Using TF-IDF or word embeddings for text representation.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Key Steps:
- 📝 **Text Cleaning**: Lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming.
- 📊 **Word Frequency Analysis**: Finding the most common words in hate speech.
- 🏷 **Class Distribution**: Checking data balance between labels.
- 🔠 **N-grams Analysis**: Understanding common word sequences in hateful tweets.
